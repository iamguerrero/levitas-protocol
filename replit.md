# Levitas Finance - Volatility Token DApp

## Overview

This project is a decentralized finance (DeFi) application called Levitas Finance that provides tokenized volatility products. It's a React frontend DApp with Ethers.js Web3 integration, featuring volatility index tokens (BVIX, EVIX, VIXC) that allow users to hedge their cryptocurrency holdings on Polygon Amoy testnet.

‚úì **TRUE COLLATERAL RATIO ENFORCEMENT** - V5 contracts implement mintWithCollateralRatio(amount, targetCR) where users spend full USDC but receive proportional tokens based on selected CR
‚úì **FRONTEND UPDATED FOR V5** - Updated all mint functions to use V5 contracts, removed V4 warnings, added proper CR parameter passing
‚úì **VAULT STATS API UPDATED** - Backend now queries V5 contracts for accurate collateral ratio monitoring
‚úì **CONTRACT INTERFACE SIMPLIFIED** - Removed "Stack too deep" compilation errors by creating simplified V5Simple contracts

‚úì **CR DISPLAY CLARIFICATION** - UI now clearly shows Target CR (user's selection) vs Vault CR (actual collateral ratio)
‚úì **CRITICAL CR CALCULATION FIX** - Fixed decimal handling bug in backend CR calculation (oracle uses 18 decimals, not 8)
‚úì **VAULT-SPECIFIC CR TRACKING** - Fixed CR calculation to show individual BVIX vault CR instead of confusing protocol-wide combined CR  
‚úì **PROTOCOL-WIDE CR RESTORED** - Reverted to correct protocol-wide CR calculation per user feedback
üîß **EVIX MINTING BUG IDENTIFIED** - EVIX mint creates almost no tokens despite spending USDC, causing incorrect CR behavior
‚úÖ **COMPLETE PROTOCOL WITH FAUCET** - Deployed final contracts with MockUSDC faucet: MockUSDC (0x9CC37B36FDd8CF5c0297BE15b75663Bf2a193297), BVIX (0xdcCCCC3A977cC0166788265eD4B683D41f3AED09), BVIX MintRedeem (0x4d0ddFBCBa76f2e72B0Fef2fdDcaE9ddd6922397), EVIX (0x089C132BC246bF2060F40B0608Cb14b2A0cC9127), EVIX MintRedeem (0xb187c5Ff48D69BB0b477dAf30Eec779E0D07771D). Users can now get test USDC via faucet button.
‚ö†Ô∏è **POLYGON AMOY NETWORK ISSUES (July 25, 2025)** - Widespread "missing trie node" RPC errors affecting Polygon Amoy testnet causing mint/redeem transactions to fail in MetaMask. This is a confirmed network-wide issue, not a code problem. Alternative RPCs (PublicNode, Ankr) are also experiencing issues. The migration from Base Sepolia to Polygon Amoy is complete and correct - only the testnet infrastructure is unstable.
‚úì **Vault Health Real-Time Updates** - Updated vault stats API to use V4 contracts and reduced refresh interval to 5 seconds for faster updates
‚úì **Post-Transaction Cache Invalidation** - Added automatic vault cache refresh after BVIX transactions for immediate collateral ratio updates (EVIX transactions don't affect BVIX vault)
‚úì **Comprehensive Debug Logging** - Added detailed console logging for mint process troubleshooting
‚úì **Fresh Contract Architecture** - Clean deployment eliminating legacy ownership conflicts from previous versions
‚úì **Collateral Ratio Slider Fixed** - Slider now properly calculates token amounts based on selected CR (150% CR = fewer tokens, 200% CR = even fewer)
‚úì **USDC Balance Error Handling** - Added clear guidance when users have 0 USDC balance with faucet links for Base Sepolia test USDC
‚úì **Industry-Standard Collateral-Aware Minting** - Complete DeFi-standard interface with safe mint amounts, smart suggestions, and clear collateral impact visualization
‚úì **V2 Collateral Enforcement Fixed** - Deployed MintRedeemV2 (0x685FEc86...) with proper 120% collateral ratio enforcement that actually works
‚úì **Network Setup UI** - Added Base Sepolia network helper and testnet ETH faucet buttons 
‚úì **Live Vault Health Dashboard** - Complete collateral ratio monitoring with real-time API endpoint and UI widget
‚úì **EVIX UI Token Switching** - Fixed clickable token cards that properly switch between BVIX/EVIX trading interfaces
‚úì **EVIX Price Integration** - Corrected Oracle price format conversion for accurate $37.98 display
‚úì **EVIX Ecosystem Complete** - Deployed EVIX Oracle (0xCd7441A...) and MintRedeem (0xe521441B...) contracts with full trading functionality
‚úì **EVIX Trading Interface** - Complete mint/redeem UI for EVIX tokens with real-time price feeds from deployed oracle
‚úì **Dual Token Support** - Added EVIX balance tracking, pricing, and wallet overview integration alongside BVIX
‚úì **EVIX Token Deployment** - Successfully deployed EVIX token contract to Base Sepolia at 0x37e3b45fEF91D54Ef4992B71382EC36307908463
