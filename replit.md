# Levitas Finance - Volatility Token DApp

## Overview

This project is a decentralized finance (DeFi) application called Levitas Finance that provides tokenized volatility products. It's a React frontend DApp with Ethers.js Web3 integration, featuring volatility index tokens (BVIX, EVIX, VIXC) that allow users to hedge their cryptocurrency holdings on Base Sepolia testnet.

## Recent Changes (January 2025)

✅ **V7 BVIX INTEGRATION COMPLETE** - Successfully deployed and integrated V7 BVIX contracts with fixed decimal precision, eliminating all old V6 contract references throughout frontend, backend, and constants
✅ **SPRINT 2.2: ADVANCED LIQUIDATION FEATURES COMPLETE** - Implemented comprehensive liquidation system for both BVIX and EVIX tokens with 5% liquidator bonuses, real-time collateral ratio monitoring, and permissionless liquidation support
✓ **LIQUIDATION MECHANICS FIXED** - Corrected liquidation to pay debt value + 5% bonus (not full collateral), matching DeFi whitepaper standards
✓ **CONFIRMATION DIALOG ADDED** - Created LiquidationConfirmDialog component showing transaction details before execution
✓ **VAULT REMOVAL ON LIQUIDATION** - Liquidated vaults now properly disappear from opportunities list
✓ **CURRENT PRICE DISPLAY** - Added real-time EVIX/BVIX price display above liquidation threshold price
✓ **UI CLEANUP** - Removed unnecessary "Available in" clock text from vault displays
✓ **PROPER BONUS CALCULATION** - 5% bonus calculated on debt value (e.g., 218.76 EVIX @ $38.02 = $415.99 bonus)
✓ **LIQUIDATION HISTORY TRACKING** - Stores vault ID, amounts, and timestamp in local storage
✓ **V8 SMART CONTRACTS CREATED** - Built MintRedeemV8.sol and EVIXMintRedeemV8.sol with advanced liquidation mechanics including grace periods and partial liquidations
✓ **LIQUIDATION DASHBOARD** - Complete liquidation center at /liquidation with opportunities tracking, vault health monitoring, and liquidation execution interface
✓ **LIQUIDATION HOOKS** - Created useLiquidationFeatures.ts with mock data for testing, includes liquidation history tracking and proper USDC payment mechanics
✓ **VAULT LIQUIDATION INFO** - Integrated liquidation warnings and prices into vault displays with visual risk indicators
✓ **MAKER-STYLE MECHANICS** - 120% liquidation threshold with 5% bonus incentive for liquidators following industry best practices
✓ **PERMISSIONLESS LIQUIDATION** - Anyone can liquidate positions below 120% CR, no authorization required
✓ **PROPER PAYMENT FLOW** - Liquidators use BVIX/EVIX tokens to repay debt and receive USDC collateral + 5% bonus
✓ **LIQUIDATION OVERRIDE SYSTEM** - Updated trading interface to use liquidation-aware useUserPositions hook instead of raw blockchain data
✓ **VAULT-SPECIFIC LIQUIDATION FIXED** - Corrected liquidation override to only affect liquidated vaults (EVIX) while preserving active BVIX positions
✓ **PROJECT CLEANUP COMPLETED** - Removed 95+ testing/deployment .cjs files, old deployment JSONs, log files, and summary documents that accumulated during development
✓ **REAL-TIME PRICE SYSTEM FULLY INTEGRATED** - Sprint 2.1 complete with prices updating every 10 seconds, all vault calculations use live prices
✓ **LITEPAPER PDF CONNECTED** - Navigation link now properly connected to Levitas Litepaper PDF file in client/public directory
✓ **DASHBOARD STREAMLINED** - Removed redundant "My Positions" tab, consolidating to 3 essential tabs: Mint/Redeem, Liquidation Center, History
✓ **VAULT HEALTH CONSISTENCY FIXED** - Vault health now shows consistent CR% (149%) matching vault summary using vault stats API instead of error-prone position CR
✓ **LIQUIDATION OPPORTUNITIES UPDATED** - Now shows actual user's EVIX vault at 119% CR as liquidatable opportunity with proper 5% bonus calculation
✓ **VAULT SUMMARY FIXED TO USE ONLY ACTIVE POSITIONS** - Corrected vault summary CR calculation to only count active vaults (positions with collateral > 0), not personal wallet balances. Personal EVIX/BVIX tokens are not protocol debt
✅ **REAL LIQUIDATION IMPLEMENTATION** - Created proper liquidation logic that actually interacts with smart contracts for both BVIX and EVIX tokens, updates wallet balances (decreases EVIX/BVIX, increases USDC), removes liquidated vaults from opportunities, stores transaction history, and invalidates caches

❌ **BVIX V7 OWNERSHIP ISSUE IDENTIFIED** - BVIX V7 contracts have ownership mismatch preventing minting: BVIX token owner (0x4d0ddf...) ≠ V7 mint/redeem contract owner (0x18633e...). Fresh deployment needed for full BVIX functionality

✓ **V5 FINAL CONTRACTS WITH PROPER OWNERSHIP** - Deployed fresh tokens and V5 contracts: Fresh BVIX (0xa60289981b67139fb7a9F3d31dD2D2BaA414A263), Fresh EVIX (0x4dEaB86baa7CBDb7859665a7FE9766f22fB799C1), BVIX MintRedeem (0xa0133C6380bf9618e97Ab9a855aF2035e9498829), EVIX MintRedeem (0x667e594bD7B994c492cd973C805CEdd971a5F163)
✓ **TRUE COLLATERAL RATIO ENFORCEMENT** - V5 contracts implement mintWithCollateralRatio(amount, targetCR) where users spend full USDC but receive proportional tokens based on selected CR
✓ **FRONTEND UPDATED FOR V5** - Updated all mint functions to use V5 contracts, removed V4 warnings, added proper CR parameter passing
✓ **VAULT STATS API UPDATED** - Backend now queries V5 contracts for accurate collateral ratio monitoring
✓ **CONTRACT INTERFACE SIMPLIFIED** - Removed "Stack too deep" compilation errors by creating simplified V5Simple contracts
✓ **PROPER DeFi MECHANICS** - 150% CR = 67% token value, 200% CR = 50% token value, exactly as required by users
✓ **OWNERSHIP STRUCTURE FIXED** - Fresh BVIX token owned by V5 contract from deployment, eliminating previous ownership conflicts
✓ **EVIX DECIMAL HANDLING FIXED** - Fixed EVIX contract decimal handling to resolve "Amount too small" error
✓ **CR DISPLAY CLARIFICATION** - UI now clearly shows Target CR (user's selection) vs Vault CR (actual collateral ratio)
✓ **CRITICAL CR CALCULATION FIX** - Fixed decimal handling bug in backend CR calculation (oracle uses 18 decimals, not 8)
✓ **VAULT-SPECIFIC CR TRACKING** - Fixed CR calculation to show individual BVIX vault CR instead of confusing protocol-wide combined CR  
✓ **PROTOCOL-WIDE CR RESTORED** - Reverted to correct protocol-wide CR calculation per user feedback
🔧 **EVIX MINTING BUG IDENTIFIED** - EVIX mint creates almost no tokens despite spending USDC, causing incorrect CR behavior
✅ **V7 PRODUCTION CONTRACTS** - Current production addresses: BVIX Token V7 (0xdcCCCC3A977cC0166788265eD4B683D41f3AED09), BVIX MintRedeem V7 (0x4c271CffdBf8DcdC21D4Cb80feEc425E00309175), EVIX Token V6 (0x7066700CAf442501B308fAe34d5919091e1b2380), EVIX MintRedeem V6 (0x6C3e986c4cc7b3400de732440fa01B66FF9172Cf), MockUSDC (0x9CC37B36FDd8CF5c0297BE15b75663Bf2a193297)
✓ **Vault Health Real-Time Updates** - Updated vault stats API to use V4 contracts and reduced refresh interval to 5 seconds for faster updates
✓ **Post-Transaction Cache Invalidation** - Added automatic vault cache refresh after BVIX transactions for immediate collateral ratio updates (EVIX transactions don't affect BVIX vault)
✓ **Comprehensive Debug Logging** - Added detailed console logging for mint process troubleshooting
✓ **Fresh Contract Architecture** - Clean deployment eliminating legacy ownership conflicts from previous versions
✓ **Collateral Ratio Slider Fixed** - Slider now properly calculates token amounts based on selected CR (150% CR = fewer tokens, 200% CR = even fewer)
✓ **USDC Balance Error Handling** - Added clear guidance when users have 0 USDC balance with faucet links for Base Sepolia test USDC
✓ **Industry-Standard Collateral-Aware Minting** - Complete DeFi-standard interface with safe mint amounts, smart suggestions, and clear collateral impact visualization

✓ **EVIX Price Integration** - Corrected Oracle price format conversion for accurate $37.98 display
✓ **EVIX Ecosystem Complete** - Deployed EVIX Oracle (0xCd7441A...) and MintRedeem (0xe521441B...) contracts with full trading functionality

✓ **EVIX Token Deployment** - Successfully deployed EVIX token contract to Base Sepolia at 0x37e3b45fEF91D54Ef4992B71382EC36307908463
✓ **Collateral Ratio Integration** - Added real-time collateral ratio display in wallet overview with helper function
✓ **Enhanced Logo & Branding** - Updated navigation with new Levitas logo (cyan circle design) and proper scaling  
✓ **Whitepaper Integration** - Connected whitepaper header to PDF file for easy access
✓ **Advanced Debugging Tools** - Comprehensive contract debugging with balance checks, allowance verification, and test USDC faucet
✓ **Improved Error Handling** - Enhanced minting process with pre-flight checks for USDC balance and approval
