# Levitas Finance - Volatility Token DApp

## Overview

This project is a decentralized finance (DeFi) application called Levitas Finance that provides tokenized volatility products. It's a React frontend DApp with Ethers.js Web3 integration, featuring volatility index tokens (BVIX, EVIX, VIXC) that allow users to hedge their cryptocurrency holdings on Base Sepolia testnet.
