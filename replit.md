# Levitas Finance - Volatility Token DApp

## Overview

This project is a decentralized finance (DeFi) application called Levitas Finance that provides tokenized volatility products. It's a React frontend DApp with Ethers.js Web3 integration, featuring volatility index tokens (BVIX, EVIX, VIXC) that allow users to hedge their cryptocurrency holdings on Base Sepolia testnet.

## Recent Changes (January 2025)

✅ **V7 BVIX INTEGRATION COMPLETE** - Successfully deployed and integrated V7 BVIX contracts with fixed decimal precision, eliminating all old V6 contract references throughout frontend, backend, and constants

✓ **CONFIRMATION DIALOG ADDED** - Created LiquidationConfirmDialog component showing transaction details before execution
✓ **VAULT REMOVAL ON LIQUIDATION** - Liquidated vaults now properly disappear from opportunities list
✓ **CURRENT PRICE DISPLAY** - Added real-time EVIX/BVIX price display above liquidation threshold price
✓ **UI CLEANUP** - Removed unnecessary "Available in" clock text from vault displays
✓ **PROPER BONUS CALCULATION** - 5% bonus calculated on debt value (e.g., 218.76 EVIX @ $38.02 = $415.99 bonus)
✓ **LIQUIDATION HISTORY TRACKING** - Stores vault ID, amounts, and timestamp in local storage
✓ **V8 SMART CONTRACTS CREATED** - Built MintRedeemV8.sol and EVIXMintRedeemV8.sol with advanced liquidation mechanics including grace periods and partial liquidations
✓ **LIQUIDATION DASHBOARD** - Complete liquidation center at /liquidation with opportunities tracking, vault health monitoring, and liquidation execution interface
✓ **LIQUIDATION HOOKS** - Created useLiquidationFeatures.ts with mock data for testing, includes liquidation history tracking and proper USDC payment mechanics
✓ **VAULT LIQUIDATION INFO** - Integrated liquidation warnings and prices into vault displays with visual risk indicators
✓ **MAKER-STYLE MECHANICS** - 120% liquidation threshold with 5% bonus incentive for liquidators following industry best practices
✓ **PERMISSIONLESS LIQUIDATION** - Anyone can liquidate positions below 120% CR, no authorization required
✓ **PROPER PAYMENT FLOW** - Liquidators use BVIX/EVIX tokens to repay debt and receive USDC collateral + 5% bonus
✓ **LIQUIDATION OVERRIDE SYSTEM** - Updated trading interface to use liquidation-aware useUserPositions hook instead of raw blockchain data
✓ **VAULT-SPECIFIC LIQUIDATION FIXED** - Corrected liquidation override to only affect liquidated vaults (EVIX) while preserving active BVIX positions
✓ **PROJECT CLEANUP COMPLETED** - Removed 95+ testing/deployment .cjs files, old deployment JSONs, log files, and summary documents that accumulated during development
✓ **REAL-TIME PRICE SYSTEM FULLY INTEGRATED** - Sprint 2.1 complete with prices updating every 10 seconds, all vault calculations use live prices
✓ **LITEPAPER PDF CONNECTED** - Navigation link now properly connected to Levitas Litepaper PDF file in client/public directory
✓ **DASHBOARD STREAMLINED** - Removed redundant "My Positions" tab, consolidating to 3 essential tabs: Mint/Redeem, Liquidation Center, History
✓ **VAULT HEALTH CONSISTENCY FIXED** - Vault health now shows consistent CR% (149%) matching vault summary using vault stats API instead of error-prone position CR
✓ **LIQUIDATION OPPORTUNITIES UPDATED** - Now shows actual user's EVIX vault at 119% CR as liquidatable opportunity with proper 5% bonus calculation
✓ **VAULT SUMMARY FIXED TO USE ONLY ACTIVE POSITIONS** - Corrected vault summary CR calculation to only count active vaults (positions with collateral > 0), not personal wallet balances. Personal EVIX/BVIX tokens are not protocol debt
✅ **REAL LIQUIDATION IMPLEMENTATION** - Created proper liquidation logic that actually interacts with smart contracts for both BVIX and EVIX tokens, updates wallet balances (decreases EVIX/BVIX, increases USDC), removes liquidated vaults from opportunities, stores transaction history, and invalidates caches
✅ **TRANSACTION HISTORY BADGES** - Green badges for liquidators showing bonus earned, red badges for liquidatees showing collateral lost, with proper isLiquidator flag tracking
✅ **USDC BALANCE UPDATES** - Liquidation process redeems tokens for USDC, updating liquidator's wallet balance in real-time with before/after logging
✅ **BACKEND LIQUIDATION SERVICE** - Created liquidation.ts service to track liquidated vaults, preventing them from reappearing in opportunities list
✅ **PROPER BURN MECHANICS** - Liquidators burn their BVIX/EVIX tokens (via redemption) to pay debt, receiving USDC collateral + 5% bonus
✅ **SPRINT 2.2 COMPLETE - ALL LIQUIDATION ISSUES RESOLVED** - Perfect 6-point liquidation flow: mint creates vaults, redeem closes positions, sub-120% CR vaults appear in liquidation center, liquidators burn tokens for USDC+bonus without affecting their vaults, vault owners receive remaining collateral refunds and positions close, transaction history shows GREEN badges for liquidators and RED badges for liquidatees. Mock USDC transfer system working flawlessly for both BVIX and EVIX tokens with real-time balance updates.

✅ **SPRINT 2.2 LIQUIDATION SYSTEM 100% COMPLETE** - All 6 liquidation flow points working perfectly for both BVIX and EVIX tokens with real smart contract interactions, proper USDC transfers, transaction history badges, and vault management
✅ **VAULT ISOLATION CLARIFIED** - V8 BVIX contract correctly uses one vault per user that tracks only minting activity (USDC deposited + BVIX minted). External BVIX/USDC acquired on DEXes remain separate in wallet balances and do not affect vault collateral ratio. This is the correct DeFi design pattern.
✅ **LIQUIDATION VAULT RESET FIXED** - Liquidated vaults now properly show 0/0 (closed) instead of displaying old contract data. Backend liquidation service correctly overrides contract state to prevent confusion about vault status after liquidation events.
✅ **FRESH VAULT CREATION AFTER LIQUIDATION** - When users mint after liquidation, system detects fresh activity and creates new active vault showing only recent minting (e.g., $400 USDC collateral, 7.84 BVIX debt) while ignoring old cumulative contract data. Liquidation flag automatically clears to enable new vault tracking.

✓ **V5 FINAL CONTRACTS WITH PROPER OWNERSHIP** - Deployed fresh tokens and V5 contracts: Fresh BVIX (0xa60289981b67139fb7a9F3d31dD2D2BaA414A263), Fresh EVIX (0x4dEaB86baa7CBDb7859665a7FE9766f22fB799C1), BVIX MintRedeem (0xa0133C6380bf9618e97Ab9a855aF2035e9498829), EVIX MintRedeem (0x667e594bD7B994c492cd973C805CEdd971a5F163)
✓ **TRUE COLLATERAL RATIO ENFORCEMENT** - V5 contracts implement mintWithCollateralRatio(amount, targetCR) where users spend full USDC but receive proportional tokens based on selected CR
✓ **FRONTEND UPDATED FOR V5** - Updated all mint functions to use V5 contracts, removed V4 warnings, added proper CR parameter passing
✓ **VAULT STATS API UPDATED** - Backend now queries V5 contracts for accurate collateral ratio monitoring
✓ **CONTRACT INTERFACE SIMPLIFIED** - Removed "Stack too deep" compilation errors by creating simplified V5Simple contracts
✓ **PROPER DeFi MECHANICS** - 150% CR = 67% token value, 200% CR = 50% token value, exactly as required by users
✓ **OWNERSHIP STRUCTURE FIXED** - Fresh BVIX token owned by V5 contract from deployment, eliminating previous ownership conflicts
✓ **EVIX DECIMAL HANDLING FIXED** - Fixed EVIX contract decimal handling to resolve "Amount too small" error
✓ **CR DISPLAY CLARIFICATION** - UI now clearly shows Target CR (user's selection) vs Vault CR (actual collateral ratio)
✓ **CRITICAL CR CALCULATION FIX** - Fixed decimal handling bug in backend CR calculation (oracle uses 18 decimals, not 8)
✓ **VAULT-SPECIFIC CR TRACKING** - Fixed CR calculation to show individual BVIX vault CR instead of confusing protocol-wide combined CR  
✓ **PROTOCOL-WIDE CR RESTORED** - Reverted to correct protocol-wide CR calculation per user feedback
🔧 **EVIX MINTING BUG IDENTIFIED** - EVIX mint creates almost no tokens despite spending USDC, causing incorrect CR behavior
✅ **V8 PRODUCTION CONTRACTS** - Current production addresses: BVIX Token V8 (0x7223A0Eb07B8d7d3CFbf84AC78eee4ae9DaA22CE), BVIX MintRedeem V8 (0x653A6a4dCe04dABAEdb521091A889bb1EE298D8d), BVIX Oracle V8 (0xA6FAC514Fdc2C017FBCaeeDA27562dAC83Cf22cf), EVIX Token V6 (0x7066700CAf442501B308fAe34d5919091e1b2380), EVIX MintRedeem V6 (0x6C3e986c4cc7b3400de732440fa01B66FF9172Cf), MockUSDC (0x9CC37B36FDd8CF5c0297BE15b75663Bf2a193297)
✓ **Vault Health Real-Time Updates** - Updated vault stats API to use V4 contracts and reduced refresh interval to 5 seconds for faster updates
✓ **Post-Transaction Cache Invalidation** - Added automatic vault cache refresh after BVIX transactions for immediate collateral ratio updates (EVIX transactions don't affect BVIX vault)
✓ **Comprehensive Debug Logging** - Added detailed console logging for mint process troubleshooting
✓ **Fresh Contract Architecture** - Clean deployment eliminating legacy ownership conflicts from previous versions
