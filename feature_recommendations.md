# Levitas Finance Feature Recommendations

As your new CTO with 30+ years in blockchain and DeFi, I've reviewed the whitepaper and codebase. Levitas Finance is a novel DeFi protocol providing tokenized volatility products (e.g., BVIX for Bitcoin volatility, EVIX for Ethereum) backed by USDC collateral. It enables users to hedge crypto volatility on Ethereum Network & Base Network.

This roadmap evolves the project into a top DeFi protocol and top 100 crypto project. Phases are prioritized for quick wins, security, UX, and growth. We'll follow best practices: ERC standards, audits, modular code, gas optimization, and user-centric design.

## Phase 1: Security Hardening Sprint (Immediate Priority - 1-2 weeks)
**Goals:** Move from dev-grade to audit-ready code before mainnet deployment.

### ✅ Sprint 1.1: Oracle Security (Days 1-3) - **COMPLETED**
- ✅ Replace `contracts/MockOracle.sol` with production-grade oracle interface
  - ✅ If Chainlink available on Base & Sepolia: import `AggregatorV3Interface`
  - ✅ Else create `PriceOracle.sol` with:
    * ✅ Role-based update (`AccessControl`)
    * ✅ 3-minute TWAP buffer to prevent single-tx manipulation
    * ✅ Timelock (2 min on testnet, 1 day on mainnet) for `pushPrice()`
- ✅ BVIX pegged to Volmex BVIV Index, EVIX pegged to Volmex EVIV index
- ✅ **Deliverables:** Production oracle contract, integration tests
- 📁 **Files Created:** `contracts/PriceOracle.sol`, `contracts/ChainlinkOracle.sol`

### ✅ Sprint 1.2: Access Control & Pausability (Days 4-6) - **COMPLETED**
- ✅ In MintRedeem, Vault, and all modules:
  - ✅ Inherit `AccessControl`, define roles: `GOVERNOR`, `PAUSER`, `LIQUIDATOR`
  - ✅ `mint()` / `redeem()` → add `nonReentrant` modifier
  - ✅ `pause()` / `unpause()` callable only by `PAUSER` role
