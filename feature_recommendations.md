# Levitas Finance Feature Recommendations

As your new CTO with 30+ years in blockchain and DeFi, I've reviewed the whitepaper and codebase. Levitas Finance is a novel DeFi protocol providing tokenized volatility products (e.g., BVIX for Bitcoin volatility, EVIX for Ethereum) backed by USDC collateral. It enables users to hedge crypto volatility on Ethereum Network & Base Network.

This roadmap evolves the project into a top DeFi protocol and top 100 crypto project. Phases are prioritized for quick wins, security, UX, and growth. We'll follow best practices: ERC standards, audits, modular code, gas optimization, and user-centric design.

## Phase 1: Security Hardening Sprint (Immediate Priority - 1-2 weeks)
**Goals:** Move from dev-grade to audit-ready code before mainnet deployment.

### Sprint 1.1: Oracle Security (Days 1-3)
- Replace `contracts/MockOracle.sol` with production-grade oracle interface
  - If Chainlink available on Base & Sepolia: import `AggregatorV3Interface`
  - Else create `PriceOracle.sol` with:
    * Role-based update (`AccessControl`)
    * 3-minute TWAP buffer to prevent single-tx manipulation
    * Timelock (2 min on testnet, 1 day on mainnet) for `pushPrice()`
- BVIX pegged to Volmex BVIV Index, EVIX pegged to Volmex EVIV index
- **Deliverables:** Production oracle contract, integration tests

### Sprint 1.2: Access Control & Pausability (Days 4-6)
- In MintRedeem, Vault, and all modules:
  - Inherit `AccessControl`, define roles: `GOVERNOR`, `PAUSER`, `LIQUIDATOR`
  - `mint()` / `redeem()` → add `nonReentrant` modifier
  - `pause()` / `unpause()` callable only by `PAUSER` role
  - Guard `updateCollateralParams()`, `sweepTokens()` with `GOVERNOR` role
- **Deliverables:** Role-based access control, pause mechanisms

### Sprint 1.3: Liquidations (Days 7-9)
- Implement `liquidate(address vault)`:
  * Pull fresh price from PriceOracle
  * If vault CR < 120%, let caller repay debt and seize discounted collateral (5% bonus)
  * Emit `Liquidation()` event
- Write Foundry tests:
  * Fuzz vault creation, under-collateralization, liquidation flow
  * Edge-cases: zero-debt vault, small-dust vaults
- **Deliverables:** Liquidation mechanism, comprehensive tests

### Sprint 1.4: Static Analysis & CI (Days 10-11)
- Add `slither` and `foundry` to repo; create GitHub Action:
  * `slither . --ignore-compile`
  * `forge test --ffi -vv`
  * Fail PR if high-severity issues
- Run `npm run slither` locally; paste report to `/audits/slither-pre.txt`
- **Deliverables:** CI pipeline, security analysis reports

### Sprint 1.5: Front-end Security Updates (Days 12-13)
- Update `web3.ts`:
  * Point to new PriceOracle address
  * Surface "Oracle delay" countdown in UI header
- Vault card:
  * Show liquidation price
  * Warning banner if CR < 125%
- **Deliverables:** Updated frontend with security indicators

### Sprint 1.6: Deployment Script & Verification (Day 14)
- `scripts/deploy.ts`:
  * Deploy PriceOracle → grant `GOVERNOR` role to deployer, revoke deployer's admin rights, hand admin to Timelock
  * Deploy MintRedeem pointing to oracle
  * Verify all on Etherscan / Basescan (solc 0.8.21, optimize 200)
- **Deliverables:** Production deployment scripts, verified contracts

**Phase 1 Success Criteria:**
- All Solidity code compiled & tests passing (`pnpm test` green)
- Updated `hardhat.config.ts` with Slither plugin
- `SECURITY.md` appended with "How to report" + high-level threat model
- Zero high-severity issues in static analysis
- Branch `feat/security-pass` ready for PR

## Phase 2: Security Audit & Compliance (2-3 months)
**Goals:** Fortify protocol against exploits and ensure regulatory readiness.

- Full security audit by top firm (e.g., PeckShield, Trail of Bits)
- Implement timelocks and multisig for admin functions
- Add emergency pause mechanisms
- KYC/AML integration for high-value users
- Bug bounty program on Immunefi
- Regulatory compliance framework

## Phase 3: User Experience Enhancements (3-4 months)
**Goals:** Make the platform intuitive and accessible to drive adoption.

- Mobile-responsive UI with dark mode
- Onboarding tutorials and volatility education center
- Portfolio dashboard showing position CR, PNL, and hedging simulations
- Gasless transactions via meta-transactions
- Multi-language support and fiat on-ramps

## Phase 4: Advanced DeFi Features (4-6 months)
**Goals:** Expand product suite to increase TVL and utility.

- Lending/Borrowing: Allow borrowing against volatility tokens
- Perpetual futures on volatility indices
- Options/derivatives for advanced hedging
- Cross-chain bridging to Ethereum, Arbitrum
- Yield farming with LP tokens

## Phase 5: Ecosystem and Scaling (6-9 months)
**Goals:** Integrate with broader DeFi ecosystem and scale users.

- Partnerships with DEXs (Uniswap, Sushi) for liquidity
- API for third-party integrations (e.g., portfolio trackers)
- Layer-2 optimizations for lower fees
- Mobile app development
- Community grants program

## Phase 6: Governance and Sustainability (9+ months)
**Goals:** Decentralize control and ensure long-term growth.

- Launch governance token (LEV) with DAO voting
- Revenue sharing with token holders
- Carbon-neutral operations
- Continuous R&D for new volatility products (e.g., altcoin indices)

We'll track progress with weekly updates, referring to this file daily. Let's begin with Sprint 1.1 - Oracle Security implementation.
