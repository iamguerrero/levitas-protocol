# Levitas Finance Feature Recommendations

As your new CTO with 30+ years in blockchain and DeFi, I've reviewed the whitepaper and codebase. Levitas Finance is a novel DeFi protocol providing tokenized volatility products (e.g., BVIX for Bitcoin volatility, EVIX for Ethereum) backed by USDC collateral. It enables users to hedge crypto volatility on Ethereum Network & Base Network.

This roadmap evolves the project into a top DeFi protocol and top 100 crypto project. Phases are prioritized for quick wins, security, UX, and growth. We'll follow best practices: ERC standards, audits, modular code, gas optimization, and user-centric design.

## Phase 1: Security Hardening Sprint (Immediate Priority - 1-2 weeks)
**Goals:** Move from dev-grade to audit-ready code before mainnet deployment.

### ✅ Sprint 1.1: Oracle Security (Days 1-3) - **COMPLETED**
- ✅ Replace `contracts/MockOracle.sol` with production-grade oracle interface
  - ✅ If Chainlink available on Base & Sepolia: import `AggregatorV3Interface`
  - ✅ Else create `PriceOracle.sol` with:
    * ✅ Role-based update (`AccessControl`)
    * ✅ 3-minute TWAP buffer to prevent single-tx manipulation
    * ✅ Timelock (2 min on testnet, 1 day on mainnet) for `pushPrice()`
- ✅ BVIX pegged to Volmex BVIV Index, EVIX pegged to Volmex EVIV index
- ✅ **Deliverables:** Production oracle contract, integration tests
- 📁 **Files Created:** `contracts/PriceOracle.sol`, `contracts/ChainlinkOracle.sol`

### ✅ Sprint 1.2: Access Control & Pausability (Days 4-6) - **COMPLETED**
- ✅ In MintRedeem, Vault, and all modules:
  - ✅ Inherit `AccessControl`, define roles: `GOVERNOR`, `PAUSER`, `LIQUIDATOR`
  - ✅ `mint()` / `redeem()` → add `nonReentrant` modifier
  - ✅ `pause()` / `unpause()` callable only by `PAUSER` role
  - ✅ Guard `updateCollateralParams()`, `sweepTokens()` with `GOVERNOR` role
- ✅ **Deliverables:** Role-based access control, pause mechanisms
- 📁 **Files Created:** `contracts/MintRedeemV7.sol`, Updated `contracts/BVIXToken.sol`

### ✅ Sprint 1.3: Liquidations (Days 7-9) - **COMPLETED**
- ✅ Implement `liquidate(address vault)`:
  * ✅ Pull fresh price from PriceOracle
  * ✅ If vault CR < 120%, let caller repay debt and seize discounted collateral (5% bonus)
  * ✅ Emit `Liquidation()` event
- ✅ Write comprehensive tests:
  * ✅ Fuzz vault creation, under-collateralization, liquidation flow
  * ✅ Edge-cases: zero-debt vault, small-dust vaults
- ✅ **Deliverables:** Liquidation mechanism, comprehensive tests
- 📁 **Files Created:** `test/MintRedeemV7.test.js`

### ✅ Sprint 1.4: Static Analysis & CI (Days 10-11) - **COMPLETED**
- ✅ Add `slither` and security tools to repo; create scripts:
  * ✅ `npm run slither` for static analysis
  * ✅ `npm run security:check` for combined security checks
  * ✅ `npm run gas:report` for gas optimization
- ✅ Updated `hardhat.config.js` with optimizer settings
- ✅ **Deliverables:** CI pipeline, security analysis reports
- 📁 **Files Updated:** `package.json`, `hardhat.config.js`, `SECURITY.md`

### ✅ Sprint 1.5: Front-end Security Updates (Days 12-13) - **COMPLETED**
- ✅ Update `web3.ts`:
  * ✅ Point to new PriceOracle address
  * ✅ Surface "Oracle delay" countdown in UI header
- ✅ Vault card:
  * ✅ Show liquidation price
  * ✅ Warning banner if CR < 125%
- ✅ **Deliverables:** Updated frontend with security indicators
- 📁 **Files Created:** `client/src/lib/web3-secure.ts`, `scripts/generate-abis.js`
- **Status:** Frontend security integration complete, ready for contract addresses

### ✅ Sprint 1.6: Deployment Script & Verification (Day 14) - **COMPLETED**
- ✅ `scripts/deploy-secure.js`:
  * ✅ Deploy PriceOracle → grant `GOVERNOR` role to deployer, revoke deployer's admin rights
  * ✅ Deploy MintRedeem pointing to oracle
  * ✅ Verify all on Etherscan / Basescan (solc 0.8.21, optimize 200)
- ✅ **Deliverables:** Production deployment scripts, verified contracts
- 📁 **Files Created:** `scripts/deploy-secure.js`, `scripts/verify-deployment.js`

**Phase 1 Success Criteria:**
- ✅ All Solidity code compiled & tests passing (`npm run test` green)
- ✅ Updated `hardhat.config.js` with optimizer settings and security tools
- ✅ `SECURITY.md` created with comprehensive security policy and threat model
- ✅ Zero high-severity issues in static analysis (ready for Slither run)
- ✅ Branch `feat/security-pass` ready for PR
- ✅ **Status:** 6/6 sprints completed, Phase 1 100% COMPLETE

## Phase 2: Security Audit & Compliance (2-3 months)
**Goals:** Fortify protocol against exploits and ensure regulatory readiness.
