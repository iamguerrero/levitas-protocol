"# Levitas Finance Feature Recommendations

As your new CTO with 30+ years in blockchain and DeFi, I've reviewed the whitepaper and codebase. Levitas Finance is a novel DeFi protocol providing tokenized volatility products (e.g., BVIX for Bitcoin volatility, EVIX for Ethereum) backed by USDC collateral. It enables users to hedge crypto volatility on Base network.

This roadmap evolves the project into a top DeFi protocol and top 100 crypto project. Phases are prioritized for quick wins, security, UX, and growth. We'll follow best practices: ERC standards, audits, modular code, gas optimization, and user-centric design.

## Phase 1: Core Protocol Fixes and Stability (1-2 months)
**Goals:** Fix critical issues, ensure protocol reliability, and build user trust. Focus on the vault mechanism to prevent capital loss and tighten peg.

- **Priority Fix: Surplus-Refunding Vault (MintRedeem V3)**
  - Make vault position-aware: Track individual user positions with deposited collateral and minted tokens.
  - Implement ERC-4626 standard for tokenized vaults: Add share-based minting/redeeming, asset() for USDC, totalAssets() for vault balance.
  - On redeem: Refund full proportional collateral including surplus (after fees), not just principal. Example: 150 USDC in at 150% CR mints ~100 BVIX; redeem returns ~150 USDC (minus fees), maintaining peg.
  - Add CR validation: Prevent mints below 120% global CR; suggest max mintable amount.
  - UI Integration: Slider for target CR (120-300%), real-time previews of mintable tokens and post-mint CR.

- Audit V3 contracts before mainnet.
- Deploy on testnet for community testing.
- Metrics: Achieve 100% test coverage, zero critical bugs.

## Phase 2: Security and Compliance (2-3 months)
**Goals:** Fortify protocol against exploits and ensure regulatory readiness.

- Full security audit by top firm (e.g., PeckShield).
- Implement timelocks and multisig for admin functions.
- Add emergency pause mechanisms.
- Integrate Chainlink oracles for reliable pricing (replace MockOracle).
- KYC/AML integration for high-value users.
- Bug bounty program on Immunefi.

## Phase 3: User Experience Enhancements (3-4 months)
**Goals:** Make the platform intuitive and accessible to drive adoption.

- Mobile-responsive UI with dark mode.
- Onboarding tutorials and volatility education center.
- Portfolio dashboard showing position CR, PNL, and hedging simulations.
- Gasless transactions via meta-transactions.
- Multi-language support and fiat on-ramps.

## Phase 4: Advanced DeFi Features (4-6 months)
**Goals:** Expand product suite to increase TVL and utility.

- Lending/Borrowing: Allow borrowing against volatility tokens.
- Perpetual futures on volatility indices.
- Options/derivatives for advanced hedging.
- Cross-chain bridging to Ethereum, Arbitrum.
- Yield farming with LP tokens.

## Phase 5: Ecosystem and Scaling (6-9 months)
**Goals:** Integrate with broader DeFi ecosystem and scale users.

- Partnerships with DEXs (Uniswap, Sushi) for liquidity.
- API for third-party integrations (e.g., portfolio trackers).
- Layer-2 optimizations for lower fees.
- Mobile app development.
- Community grants program.

## Phase 6: Governance and Sustainability (9+ months)
**Goals:** Decentralize control and ensure long-term growth.

- Launch governance token (LEV) with DAO voting.
- Revenue sharing with token holders.
- Carbon-neutral operations.
- Continuous R&D for new volatility products (e.g., altcoin indices).
