# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously at Levitas Finance. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

### How to Report

1. **DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities
2. **DO** email security@levitas.finance with the subject line `[SECURITY VULNERABILITY]`
3. **DO** include detailed information about the vulnerability:
   - Description of the issue
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact assessment
   - Suggested fix (if any)

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 24 hours
- **Status Update**: Within 72 hours
- **Resolution**: Within 30 days (depending on severity)

### Bug Bounty Program

We offer rewards for valid security vulnerabilities:
- **Critical**: $10,000 - $50,000
- **High**: $5,000 - $10,000
- **Medium**: $1,000 - $5,000
- **Low**: $100 - $1,000

## Security Features

### Access Control
- Role-based access control using OpenZeppelin's `AccessControl`
- Roles: `GOVERNOR`, `PAUSER`, `LIQUIDATOR`, `PRICE_UPDATER`
- Admin role revocation from deployer on contract deployment

### Oracle Security
- Production-grade `PriceOracle` with timelock protection
- 3-minute TWAP buffer to prevent price manipulation
- Price bounds validation ($1 - $1,000,000)
- Staleness checks for price feeds
- Chainlink integration with fallback mechanisms

### Reentrancy Protection
- `nonReentrant` modifier on all state-changing functions
- Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern implementation
- External call protection

### Pausability
- Emergency pause functionality for all critical operations
- Role-restricted pause/unpause operations
- Graceful degradation during paused state

### Liquidation Mechanism
- Automated liquidation of undercollateralized positions
- 5% liquidation bonus for liquidators
- Role-restricted liquidation execution
- Comprehensive liquidation validation

## Threat Model

### Attack Vectors

#### 1. Oracle Manipulation
- **Threat**: Malicious actors manipulating price feeds
- **Mitigation**: Timelock, TWAP buffer, price bounds, multiple oracle sources

#### 2. Reentrancy Attacks
- **Threat**: Recursive calls during state changes
- **Mitigation**: `nonReentrant` modifiers, CEI pattern

#### 3. Access Control Bypass
- **Threat**: Unauthorized access to admin functions
- **Mitigation**: Role-based access control, admin role revocation

#### 4. Flash Loan Attacks
- **Threat**: Large-scale manipulation using flash loans
- **Mitigation**: Collateral ratio checks, liquidation mechanisms

#### 5. Economic Attacks
- **Threat**: Manipulation of collateral ratios for profit
- **Mitigation**: Minimum collateral requirements, liquidation thresholds

### Risk Assessment

#### High Risk
- Oracle price manipulation
- Reentrancy vulnerabilities
- Access control failures

#### Medium Risk
- Economic arbitrage
- Gas optimization attacks
- Front-running

#### Low Risk
- UI/UX vulnerabilities
- Documentation errors
- Minor gas inefficiencies

## Security Best Practices

### For Developers
1. **Code Review**: All changes require security review
2. **Testing**: Comprehensive test coverage including edge cases
3. **Static Analysis**: Regular Slither scans
4. **Audits**: Third-party security audits before mainnet

### For Users
1. **Verify Contracts**: Always verify contract addresses
2. **Monitor Positions**: Regularly check collateral ratios
3. **Use Trusted Sources**: Only interact through official frontend
4. **Keep Private Keys Secure**: Never share private keys

### For Auditors
1. **Focus Areas**:
   - Oracle manipulation resistance
   - Reentrancy protection
   - Access control implementation
   - Economic model validation
   - Liquidation mechanism security

2. **Testing Requirements**:
   - Fuzz testing for edge cases
   - Integration testing with oracles
   - Stress testing under extreme conditions

## Incident Response

### Emergency Contacts
- **Security Team**: security@levitas.finance
- **Technical Lead**: tech@levitas.finance
- **Community**: Discord #security channel

### Response Procedures
1. **Detection**: Automated monitoring and community reports
2. **Assessment**: Immediate impact and scope evaluation
3. **Containment**: Pause affected functions if necessary
4. **Resolution**: Deploy fixes and security patches
5. **Communication**: Transparent updates to community
6. **Post-Mortem**: Document lessons learned

## Security Audits

### Completed Audits
- [ ] Internal security review
- [ ] Third-party audit (scheduled)
- [ ] Bug bounty program (planned)

### Audit Scope
