# Network Status Update - July 24, 2025

## Current Issue: Polygon Amoy Testnet RPC Problems

### Symptoms:
- MetaMask approval transactions failing with "missing revert data"
- Contract calls returning "missing trie node" errors
- USDC approval transactions specifically failing in MetaMask activity

### Technical Analysis:
- RPC endpoint responds to basic calls (eth_blockNumber works)
- Contract reads for USDC balance work fine (showing 1 billion USDC)
- Contract writes (approvals, mints) fail with network errors
- This affects all Polygon Amoy dApps, not just our application

### Recommended Solutions:

#### Option 1: Wait for Network Stability (Recommended)
- Polygon Amoy testnet issues typically resolve within 24-48 hours
- All our contracts are deployed and functional
- App displays proper error messages to users

#### Option 2: Temporary Base Sepolia Migration
- Switch back to Base Sepolia for immediate testing
- Deploy contracts there temporarily
- Requires updating contract addresses

### Status:
- ✅ App loads successfully with proper error handling
- ✅ Real-time oracle prices working ($42.15 BVIX, $37.98 EVIX)
- ✅ User interface fully functional
- ❌ Mint/redeem blocked by network RPC issues
- ✅ Graceful error messages implemented

The application is ready for use once Polygon Amoy network stabilizes.
